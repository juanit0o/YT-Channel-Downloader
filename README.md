# YT-Channel-Downloader
A python application to download all of the videos posted by a Youtube channel.

It follows a similar approach to my previous Youtube Downloader where you can choose to download
* Only Audio
* Highest Quality Available video
* Average Quality Available video
* Lowest Quality Available video

It is an easy way to download all of the videos in a channel that aren't in any playlist and save them at your own liking in your computer.
You also have the option to 
* Download all of the videos

As of now, pytube has some problems in its regex searches and ability to search only by a keyword but it is being solved on their side and expected to be solved in the next version.

Hope you enjoy it and find it useful!

###### This was made using the pytube library and you have to have <a href=https://www.ffmpeg.org/>ffmpeg</a> installed and set in your ambient variables.
